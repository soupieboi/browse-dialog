Active directory is a collection of multiple services designed to preform different tasks.

The Azure AD (active directory) Overview is also a collection of multiple services,

It's like an umbrella of different products and services.

- Azure Active Directory Admin Center

	AAD is like a dedicated page for all tasks specified to the Azure AD.

- Azure AD join

	Azure AD join is mainly used for bigger companies that have devices that they hand out.

There are multiple services that you can choose from depending on which is most appropriate to your situation.

for instance: 

	- Azure AD Domain Services is used if you are using older directories.

	- Support for SaaS and PaaS Applications, (software as a service and Product as a service).

	- Application proxy is used to verify a user -- whether that be through username and password or through other means -- through the cloud.


Modern Authentication doesn't work by having a UAP anymore, instead it works as following:

The user send their UAP to a IDP (identity provider) and in return, the user receives a Token.
Then the user sends that token to the server and in return the server sends that to the IDP.
The server can then either verify the token because the server has a trust relationship with the IDP.
Or simply knowledge of the provider's SIK (sign in key) is enough to check the cryptographic signature on the token.

A token is a signed document, much rather a cryptographically signed document.
