To do list Modal Project.


Make a counter

visualize that counter in the selected button and change the colors once there is selected > 0
BackButton only shows when selected < 1
let the counter be adjusted by the ADD button .. 
value.input >= 0 == add-button change colour

Make checkboxes that will add the requested child into an object array
Be able to select multiple products
Be able to input values into multiple inputs at the same time that sorts them into the right part of the object array
Make an error for text, dots, commas and spaces inside of the input box ..
if value.input != number display errormessage
when you press add let you see how much of what you have added underneath the input box ..
display id:293182748912.amount
Add toast notification of you adding something to the array and displaying the current ChildProduct that you are adding.
on hover, check if there is any amount inside of the childproduct and if true show a trashcan that leads you to a new list displaying the objectarray with all the current values inside of it
On the deletionpage that is displaying the current array values.. Have a toast notification pop-up when you do delete something for 3 seconds and let it close automatically
Also add an undo button that basically acts like a CTRL+Z on the toast pop-up
Have a close button on the toast pop up..
	show.bind=""

If the user searched something then display specific item (if there are any otherwise 404 error)
automatically make the parentProduct pop open






[{
"amount": "",
"name": "",
"id": "",
"sku": ""}
{
"amount": "",
"name": "",
"id": "",
"sku": ""}]


Fix hover over scss by making a variable onto the isProductDropDownActive that disables the a hover of the parentProduct or makes the hover the same color as the background
